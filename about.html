                <h2>Leilah Garrett</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Leilah Garrett, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University, with a concentration in Data Analytics and Technology. I expect to graduate in 2026 with a GPA of 3.3. My academic journey has equipped me with valuable skills in programming languages such as Python, C#, R, and SQL. I am also an active member of several organizations, including AITP, Girls Who Code, and WIT, where I engage with like-minded individuals and gain insight into the tech industry.</p>
                
                <p>My work experience has played a crucial role in shaping my professional skills. I currently work as a Server/Waiter at Acts Retirement-Life Communities, where I focus on creating enjoyable experiences for residents by providing timely service and assistance in the dining area. Previously, I worked as a Barista at Dunkin Donuts, where I honed my customer service abilities and learned the importance of maintaining a clean and organized environment. These roles have taught me patience, effective communication, and the value of serving others, all of which I carry into my professional endeavors.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to explore opportunities where I can apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios while continuing to learn and grow. My goal is to become a proficient IT professional, specializing in data analytics, and to contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I am eager to collaborate with innovative teams and leverage my problem-solving abilities to overcome challenges in the tech field.</p>
